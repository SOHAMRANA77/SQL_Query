## Introduction

SQL LEARN is a repository that contains my personal journal of SQL concepts, along with SQL scripts and queries for creating tables and databases. This project aims to serve as a learning resource and a reference for SQL enthusiasts who want to expand their knowledge and skills.

## Table of Contents

1. [SQL Journal](#sql-journal)
2. [Table and Database Queries](#table-and-database-queries)

## SQL Journal

In this repository, you'll find my journal documenting my learning journey with SQL. I've recorded my progress, insights, challenges, and solutions as I've explored various SQL concepts. The journal serves as a record of my SQL learning experience and can be valuable for others looking to learn SQL.

Feel free to explore the [SQL Journal](journal.md) to follow my learning path.

## Table and Database Queries

To practice what I've learned in SQL, I've provided a set of SQL scripts and queries that cover various topics, including table creation, database creation, and basic SQL operations. These scripts can serve as practical examples for anyone looking to work with SQL.

### Table Creation

- [create_users_table.sql](table_creation/create_users_table.sql): SQL script for creating a 'users' table with fields such as 'user_id,' 'username,' 'email,' and 'created_at.'

### Database Creation

- [create_sample_database.sql](database_creation/create_sample_database.sql): SQL script for creating a sample database named 'sampledb' and a 'users' table within it.

### Sample Queries

- [select_users.sql](sample_queries/select_users.sql): SQL query to retrieve all users from the 'users' table.
- [insert_user.sql](sample_queries/insert_user.sql): SQL query to insert a new user into the 'users' table.
- [update_user.sql](sample_queries/update_user.sql): SQL query to update user information in the 'users' table.
- [delete_user.sql](sample_queries/delete_user.sql): SQL query to delete a user from the 'users' table.

You can find these scripts and queries in their respective folders within this repository.

## Getting Started

To use the SQL scripts and queries, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SOHAMRANA77/SQL_Query.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the scripts or queries you want to use.

3. Open the script/query file using your preferred SQL client or tool.

4. Execute the script/query to create tables, databases, or perform data operations.
